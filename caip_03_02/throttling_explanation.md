# AWS Bedrock Throttling Exception - West Virginia Processing

## What Happened?

During the execution of our script to collect flower data for all 50 US states, we encountered a **ThrottlingException** when processing West Virginia (the 48th state in our list).

## Error Details

```
botocore.errorfactory.ThrottlingException: An error occurred (ThrottlingException) when calling the InvokeModel operation (reached max retries: 4): Too many requests, please wait before trying again.
```

## Why This Happened

### 1. **API Rate Limiting**
- AWS Bedrock has built-in rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- We made 47 consecutive API calls without any delays between requests
- The service detected this as potentially excessive usage

### 2. **No Rate Limiting in Our Code**
- Our script processes states sequentially without any delays
- Each API call happens immediately after the previous one completes
- This rapid-fire approach triggered AWS's throttling protection

### 3. **Cumulative Effect**
- Even though each individual request was legitimate, the volume of requests in a short time period exceeded the service's comfort threshold
- AWS Bedrock automatically throttled our requests to protect system resources

## Technical Context

### States Processed Successfully
- ✅ Alabama through Virginia (47 states)
- ❌ West Virginia (failed due to throttling)
- ⏸️ Wisconsin and Wyoming (not reached due to error)

### API Call Pattern
```python
for state in states:  # 50 states total
    responses = call_bedrock(bedrock, current_prompt)  # Immediate API call
    # No delay between calls
```

## Solutions to Prevent This

### 1. **Add Rate Limiting**
```python
import time

for state in states:
    responses = call_bedrock(bedrock, current_prompt)
    time.sleep(1)  # Wait 1 second between calls
```

### 2. **Implement Exponential Backoff**
```python
import time
import random

def call_with_retry(bedrock, prompt, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return call_bedrock(bedrock, prompt)
        except ThrottlingException:
            wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(wait_time)
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

### 3. **Batch Processing with Delays**
```python
for i, state in enumerate(states):
    if i > 0 and i % 10 == 0:  # Every 10 states
        time.sleep(5)  # Longer pause
    responses = call_bedrock(bedrock, current_prompt)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always implement rate limiting** when making multiple API calls
2. **AWS services have built-in protection** against rapid successive requests
3. **Throttling is a feature, not a bug** - it protects system stability
4. **Plan for retry logic** in production applications
5. **Monitor API usage patterns** to avoid hitting limits

## Next Steps

To complete the data collection:
1. Add rate limiting to the script
2. Implement retry logic for failed requests
3. Resume processing from West Virginia
4. Consider using AWS SDK's built-in retry mechanisms

This is a common scenario in API integration and demonstrates the importance of respecting service limits and implementing proper error handling.
