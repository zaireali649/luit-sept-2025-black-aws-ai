    "- **CI/CD for Models**:  \n",
    "  GitHub Actions, CodePipeline, or Jenkins are used to deploy models automatically when code or config changes are pushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment Management**:  \n",
    "  Teams manage dev, staging, and prod environments separately using tags, branch-based workflows, or isolated accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost and Resource Controls**:  \n",
