    "## 2. Critical Cost Management - DO's and DON'Ts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚨 MAJOR WARNING: Provisioned Throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEVER USE PROVISIONED THROUGHPUT** - This was emphasized multiple times in the call!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it is**: A 1-6 month commitment for guaranteed model capacity\n",
    "- **Why to avoid**: You're charged by the hour regardless of usage\n",
    "- **Result**: Your bill will \"shoot up\" immediately\n",
    "- **When to consider**: Only for production applications with consistent high volume (not for learning!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Tokens and Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Token ≠ Word**\n",
    "- ~1000 tokens ≈ 750 words\n",
    "- Some words require 2+ tokens\n",
    "- Both input AND output tokens are charged\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Pricing (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):**\n",
    "- Input: ~$0.003 per 1000 tokens (3/10 of a penny)\n",
    "- Output: ~$0.015 per 1000 tokens (~1 penny)\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the call example:**\n",
    "- 38 input tokens + 800+ output tokens = ~3 pennies total\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Control Best Practices:\n",
    "1. **Keep max tokens at 2000 or below**\n",
    "2. **Don't increase token limits unnecessarily**\n",
    "3. **Monitor your usage regularly**\n",
    "4. **Set up AWS billing alerts**\n",
    "5. **Use templates to standardize usage**\n"

    "### Temperature: The \"Fire on the Stove\" Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the call**: \"Think of it like fire on a stove\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low Temperature (0-0.3)**: \n",
    "  - Like low heat - predictable, controlled\n",
    "  - More factual, consistent responses\n",
    "  - Use for: Production systems, factual queries\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **High Temperature (0.7-1.0)**:\n",
    "  - Like high heat - unpredictable, creative\n",
    "  - More varied, creative responses  \n",
    "  - Use for: Creative writing, brainstorming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Key Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top K (e.g., 250)**\n",
    "- Limits the model to choosing from the top K most likely next words\n",
    "- Lower values = more focused responses\n",
    "- Higher values = more variety\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top P (e.g., 0.9)**\n",
    "- Probability threshold for token selection\n",
    "- Works with the \"smallest group of words that add up to what it's trying to say\"\n",
    "- Less commonly adjusted than Temperature and Top K\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max Tokens**\n",
    "- Maximum length of response\n",
    "- **Keep this reasonable!** Don't just max it out\n",

    "## 4. Prompt Engineering Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reality Check from the Call:\n",
    "*\"Majority of people don't know about prompt engineering. There's this kind of like, hey, this works for me, so this must be a good prompt. And that's not necessarily true.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Zero-shot vs Few-shot vs Many-shot\n",
    "- **Zero-shot**: Direct prompt with no examples\n",
    "  - *Avoid this when possible - \"very wide net, liable to catch anything\"*\n",
    "- **Few-shot**: Provide examples to guide behavior\n",
    "  - *Preferred approach - shows the model what you want*\n",
    "- **Many-shot**: Multiple examples (use sparingly due to cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Chain of Thought\n",
    "- **Key phrase**: \"Think about this step by step\"\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Encourages step-by-step reasoning instead of jumping to conclusions\n",
    "- **Example from call**: \"Think about this step by step. Give me an example of using Boto3 and GitHub Actions to deploy a pipeline that I can discuss in an interview.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Few-shot Example from the Call:\n",
    "**Positive Affirmations Template:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I need you to give me a positive affirmation. Here are some examples of things that I find positive:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Let's go!\"\n",
    "- \"You got this\"  \n",
    "- \"You're built different\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Give me 10 more examples in this style:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Constraint-driven Prompts\n",
    "- Specify format requirements\n",
    "- Set target audience level\n",
    "- Define output structure\n",
    "- Example: \"Explain this for a junior DevOps engineer\" vs \"senior level\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Role-based Prompting\n",
    "- *Note: The instructor mentioned he doesn't use this approach*\n",
    "- *\"I never use this approach... probably because so many people on LinkedIn just use it\"*\n",
    "- Can work but often overused\n",
    "\n",
    "### The TCREI Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "**TCREI** is a structured approach to prompt engineering that ensures comprehensive and effective prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **T - Task**\n",
    "- **Define the specific task** you want the AI to perform\n",
    "- Be clear and actionable\n",
    "- Example: \"Generate a professional project summary\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C - Context** \n",
    "- **Provide relevant background information**\n",
    "- Include constraints, requirements, or situational details\n",
    "- Example: \"This is for a DevOps engineer's portfolio targeting junior roles\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **R - Reference**\n",
    "- **Give examples or reference materials**\n",
    "- Show the desired format, style, or approach\n",
    "- Example: \"Here's a sample project description that works well...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **E - Evaluate**\n",
    "- **Define success criteria**\n",
    "- Specify how you'll measure if the output meets your needs\n",
    "- Example: \"The output should be 2-3 paragraphs, highlight technical skills, and be interview-ready\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **I - Iterate**\n",
    "- **Plan for refinement**\n",
    "- Be prepared to adjust and improve based on results\n",
    "- Example: Follow-up prompts to refine tone, add details, or restructure\n",
    "\n",
    "### TCREI in Practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Task: Create a technical interview talking point about my CI/CD project\n",
    "\n",
    "Context: I'm a bootcamp graduate applying for junior DevOps roles. The interviewer will likely ask about hands-on experience with automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: Good talking points usually follow this pattern:\n",
    "- Problem/Challenge\n",
    "- Solution/Approach  \n",
    "- Technologies Used\n",
    "- Results/Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate: The response should be 60-90 seconds when spoken, demonstrate technical understanding, and show problem-solving skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate: I'll refine this based on the specific job requirements and company tech stack.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework ensures your prompts are comprehensive and produce higher-quality, more targeted results.\n"

    "## 7. Prompt Templates - The Production Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Templates:\n",
    "- **Repeating the same thing every single time**\n",
    "- **Need consistent tone and structure**\n",
    "- **Handing off to non-technical users**\n",
    "- **Production deployments**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world Example from the Call:\n",
    "*\"I just had to generate a prompt for legal a couple of weeks ago so that they can take contracts and drop them into the LLM with this template to get the output that they're looking for. There's like 16 questions that they ask about every contract, and they were paying people to go and find these answers... you could just drop it in LLM and it'll be done in a few seconds.\"*\n",

    "## 9. RAG vs Fine-tuning - The Strategic Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-tuning: The Expensive Route ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the call**: *\"Fine tuning a model is probably the last thing that anybody should ever recommend\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Avoid Fine-tuning:\n",
    "- **Expensive**: \"Costs a pretty penny\"\n",
    "- **Hard to maintain**: Must retrain when data changes\n",
    "- **Time consuming**: Significant development effort\n",
    "- **Inflexible**: Can't easily update information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Consider:\n",
    "- Only when you need the model to learn very specific domain knowledge\n",
    "- When you have consistent, large-scale use cases\n",
    "- When you have significant budget and technical resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG: The Preferred Approach ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG = Retrieval Augmented Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why RAG is Better:\n",
    "- **Cost effective**: No model retraining required\n",
    "- **Fresh data**: Can access up-to-date information\n",
    "- **Easier maintenance**: Update database, not the model\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Easy to add or modify information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How RAG Works:\n",
    "1. **Query comes in** → \"What's our health policy?\"\n",
    "2. **System retrieves context** → Pulls relevant policy documents\n",
    "3. **Model generates response** → Uses retrieved context to answer\n",
    "4. **User gets answer** → Current, accurate information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-world Example from Call:\n",
    "Instead of fine-tuning a model to know company policies, RAG lets the model query a database of current policies and provide up-to-date answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line:\n",
    "*\"RAG is more common... that's how majority of people are deploying large language models\"*\n"

    "### Interview Guidelines from the Call\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ What NOT to do:\n",
    "- **Don't use AI during live interviews** (against company policies)\n",
    "- **Don't wear glasses** if you're using screens for notes (reflection gives you away!)\n",
    "- **Don't directly submit** AI responses to recruiters\n",
