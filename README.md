## 🔧 DevOps Best Practices

### Version Control
- **Git Workflow**: Feature branches, pull requests, and code reviews
- **Notebook Management**: Use `nbstripout` to remove outputs before committing
- **Model Versioning**: Track model artifacts using DVC or MLflow

### Environment Management
```bash
# Always use virtual environments
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Pin dependency versions
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Use environment variables for configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your specific settings
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install black flake8 pytest jupyter-nbextensions-configurator

# Format code
black scripts/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 scripts/ tests/

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

### Jupyter Notebook Best Practices
- Clear outputs before committing: `jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace *.ipynb`
- Use meaningful cell markdown for documentation
- Keep notebooks focused on single topics
- Extract reusable code into Python modules

### ML Model Lifecycle
1. **Experimentation**: Use notebooks for exploration and prototyping
2. **Development**: Convert notebook code to Python modules

# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Clear pip cache
pip cache purge

# Install with verbose output
pip install -v package-name
```

#### Memory Issues
- Reduce dataset size for initial learning
- Use `del` to free memory in notebooks
- Restart kernel regularly during development

#### AWS Credentials
```bash
# Configure AWS CLI
